# ElectronLauncherBackend

To run the backend server execute: npm run dev

Backend relies on a MongoDB M0 server instance (MongoDB Atlas). MongoDB Compass was primarily used as the connecting client.
For backend, any server instance is fine, like e.g. apache (xxamp). The backend_assets.zip folder and it's content must be available
for download from this webserver. Also, the MongoDB URI must be updated to point to the location of the webserver.
